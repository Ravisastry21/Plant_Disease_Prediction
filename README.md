# Plant_Disease_Prediction

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict and identify diseases in plants. By utilizing image analysis and classification algorithms, we aim to provide an efficient and accurate solution for detecting plant diseases early on, aiding in the prevention and control of crop damage. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.
